Polusi udara tersebut membuat langit Jakarta menjadi gelap dan berkabut tebal serta mengakibatkan banyak orang mengalami gangguan kesehatan terutama pada pernafasan. Akibatnya, pemerintah memberlakukan berbagai kebijakan-kebijakan untuk mengatasi masalah tersebut seperti pemberlakuan *Work From Home (WFH)*, membuat hujan buatan, menyemprot air dari atap gedung-gedung tinggi, dan masih banyak lagi. Dalam memberlakukan kebijakan-kebijakan tersebut, pemerintah tidak serta merta membuatnya begitu saja. Mereka tentunya memiliki data tentang polusi udara di Jakarta yang diambil dari sebuah alat yaitu **Stasiun Pemantau Kualitas Udara (SPKU)** yang digunakan untuk memberikan data terkait kualitas udara di sekitar alat tersebut. Namun, harga SPKU terbilang cukup mahal hingga mencapai milyaran rupiah. Selain itu, tidak semua daerah di Indonesia memiliki SPKU untuk pemantauan kualitas udara karena pada dasarnya SPKU ini terbatas hanya ditujukan untuk tempat-tempat tertentu saja seperti kota-kota besar. Padahal setiap daerah di Indonesia seharusnya berhak untuk mendapatkan kualitas udara yang bersih. Selain itu, data yang dikirimkan oleh SPKU kepada publik tidak cukup cepat dan terkini yang mana perhitungan **Indeks Standar Pencemar Udara (ISPU)** yang merupakan standar perhitungan kondisi kualitas udara hanya disampaikan paling sedikit setiap jam 09.00 dan jam 15.00. Hal tersebut dapat membuat masyarakat sekitar lambat dalam membuat tindakan pencegahan apabila terjadi kondisi yang kritis.<br>\n","Melihat masalah tersebut, saya membuat sebuah model machine learning untuk memprediksi kualitas udara di Indonesia. Model machine learning ini dilatih menggunakan algoritma **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** dengan menggunakan data dari ISPU yang dihasilkan dari SPKU di beberapa tempat termasuk di Jakarta. Dengan menggunakan model machine learning, diharapkan dapat menambah efisiensi dan fleksibilitas dalam memprediksi dan memantau kualitas udara di Indonesia."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["## **Tujuan**"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":["Project machine learning berupa Prediksi Kualitas Udara dibuat dengan tujuan sebagai berikut:\n","1.
